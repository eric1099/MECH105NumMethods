## Simpson's Method Integration
This file contains the Simpson's method algorithm for estimating the integral. The first file is the function that is ran. The algorithm means to take an inputted function of x and estimate its integral on an interval given, using the 1/3 Simpson's rule and the trapezoidal rule. The function only works for evenly spaced intervals unless it is the last interval that is unequal.
The second file is the test code that was used to run the function.
