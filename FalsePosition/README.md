## False Position
This file contains the false position method algorithm. The first file is the function that is ran. The algorithm means to execute the root finding method between the inputted interval to either a certain number of iterations or until the error meets the wanted error; whichever comes first. The function outputs a root, its f(x) value, the error and the iterations it took.
The second file is the test code that was used to run the function.
